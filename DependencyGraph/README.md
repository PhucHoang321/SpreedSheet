# Comments to Dependency Graph:
For now, I think this code will run. I run through most of the test I can think of. It passed all the given test
and also a few that developed myself.
# Assignment Specific Topics
Any additional feedback or write up required by the assignment.

Leave a space for a new paragraph.

Make sure you spell check your file (did you install the VS spell checker?) and use your best writing ability.

# Consulted Peers:

I talked with Chanphone Visathip. We went over the skeleton code and how we will construct our structure. 
He helped me understand about the mirror structure of dependees and dependents.
