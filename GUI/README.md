# Reflection on partnerships
	At first, we both did pair programmings but it didn't workout really well. Since, we have to learned a lot about the 
 	MAUI. So, we both our own branch that based on the master and assigned works to eachother. Turn out it worked really 
  	well. We both learned a lot about the MAUI. 
# Branching
	We have total of 7 branchs not included the master. 
 		1.aunAS6: Create the column, row, and spreadsheet cell.
   		2.A6_aunntayy_2 : Changed how the spreadsheet cell work. Added MyEntry class. Have Save working but not really how we 
     		wanted it to work. Add OnPageLoaded to focus a cell.
       	3.A6_aunntayy_3 : Cell able to evaluate. Phuc did something and the whole project won't work. Also master won't work after 
	 	we merge together. 
	 	4.A6_aunntayy_4 : Try to find the way to make the project work but ended up not working.
   		5.A6_Phuc_1: Deleted after create a second version.
     		6.A6_Phuc_2: A6_Phuc_1 messed up so I created a new branch. Got save, open and new button work. Also, added help page. Scrollview for the application. 
       		7.A6_Phuc_3: Debugged the save, open and new button.Also, added more features. Now, this branch is the only branch that work. 

  	We tried to merge the working branch into master branch. The master branch won't run and it will show the same errors. So we submitted this
   	branch as a final branch.
